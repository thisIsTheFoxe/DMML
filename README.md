# Data Mining & Machine Learning
This is a project for the DMML lecture in the 6th semester of the Informatics degree at the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Stuttgart. The project was part of multiple home-work projects during the COVID-pandemic in 2020. 

## Implementation of a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP)
A multi-layer perceptron is basically a fully connected neural network with at least 3 layers: input, hidden and output. There may be multiple hidden layers and each layer can have multiple nodes.

### Usage

1. Install all dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Import the neural network  
`from DMML.NeuralNetwork import NeuralNetwork`
3. Create a new neural network  
`nn = NeuralNetwork(<numberOfInputNodes>, <numberOfHiddenNodesLayer1>, ..., <numberOfOuputNodes>)`
4. (optional) adjust learning rate and activation function, defaults to 0.1 and Sigmoid.
```
nn.learningRate = <0-1>
nn.activationFunc = <some function>
nn.activationFuncD = <derivative of that function>
```
5. Train the network  
`nn.train([input1, ...], [output1, ...])`
6. Let the network predict  
`prediction = nn.predict([input1, ...])`

### `ThreeLayerNeuralNetwork`
This is a neural network with exactly 3 layers (exactly 1 hidden layer). It was the first, simple implementation of a MLP. The functionality is very similar to the new `NeuralNetwork`. Therefore the general `NeuralNetwork` should be used instead. 

## CI
There are two CI tests. The first, trivial test just proves that the CI is working as expected. The second test creates a single-layer perceptron that solves the linear separable OR-problem.

## Testing the Multi-Layer-Perceptron
The tests can be found in DMML/tests.

### Non-linear Functions
For this test two functions are defined: 
1. for a Unit Circle (scaled by 0.5)
2. a default quadratic function

Now, 50.000 random points are picked where x and y are between -1 and 1. The network should be trained to recognize if points are in a certain area, defined by the functions. The first output indicates whether the point is within the circle. The second function shows if the point lies below the plot of the quadratic function. (Outputs relate to boolean values: 0 = false; 1 = true)

After that, another 10 random points are picked and given to the network to classify. Example:
```
[0.99977432] [0.90243369] <> 1 1
[0.0151541] [0.99999997] <> 0 1
[0.01278248] [0.65513176] <> 0 1
[0.05145783] [0.02938048] <> 0 0
[0.08897768] [0.00031185] <> 0 0
[0.00601403] [0.04847992] <> 0 0
[0.0259609] [0.99819635] <> 0 1
[0.99974666] [0.01196247] <> 1 0
[0.99987619] [0.52585137] <> 1 0
[0.99996185] [0.44944496] <> 1 0
```
Left is the output of the network and right the actual result (or target). Apart from the second to last prediction, all values look good. Intuitively, (0 0) means the point is not in the circle and above the quadratic plot and (1 1) means the point is in the circle and below the quadratic plot.

### Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset of Iris flowers. It contains measurements from 150 flowers of 3 different species. 

To work with that dataset, it first needs to be split into training and testing data. The set is split according to the 3 species. Then each of the three is shuffled. Finally, 5 samples are taken out from each one for the testing data and everything is shuffled together in test and training data.

One problem in this case is that not all the data is equally prioritized. E.g. sepalLength and sepalWidth have much higher values and therefore are seen by the neural network as 'more important'.

### Diabetes
This is a dataset about people with diabetes. When looking at the data though, one can recognize that only about â…“ of the people tested positive for diabetes. Plus, the data is unclean meaning not all the data is trustworthy (for example: BloodPressure = 0, BMI = 0). For this reason, the network doesn't perform as well with the unsanitized data.
